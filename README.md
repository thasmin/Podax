Podax is a podcast downloader and player. It is heavily modeled after Google Listen, which is no longer in development.

Features include:

- keeping a list of subscriptions
- downloading new podcasts when they are available
- importing subscriptions from Google Reader
- a widget for easy pausing and resuming
- open source development at [Github](https://www.github.com/thasmin/Podax)

To get started developing Podax, you may need to rebuild the project files. You can do this by running *android sdk path*/tools/android update project -p *Podax path*. You will also need to import the submodule as projects in Eclipse. After updating the submodules, go to File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace (under General), then choose the ActionBarSherlock directory. Repeat for ViewPagerIndicator. For drag-sort-listview, use File -> Import -> Existing Android Code into Workspace (under Android). If Podax isn't compiling, go to its project properties, then Android, and readd the three libraries in the bottom section.
